## Generating a new Remix project

ðŸ’¿ Open your terminal and run this command:

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

This may ask you whether you want to install `create-remix` to run the command. Enter `y`. It will only be installed temporarily to run the setup script.

When the fun Remix animation is finished, it'll ask you a few questions. We'll call our app "twixel", choose the "Vercel" deploy target, use TypeScript, and have it run the installation for us:

```
R E M I X - v#.#.#

ðŸ’¿ Welcome to Remix! Let's get you set up with a new project.

? Where would you like to create your app? twixel
? Where do you want to deploy? Choose Remix if you're unsure, it's easy to chang
e deployment targets. Vercel
? TypeScript or JavaScript? TypeScript
? Do you want me to run `npm install`? Yes
```

Once the `npm install` has completed, we'll change into the `twixel` directory:

ðŸ’¿ Run this command

```sh
cd twixel
```

Now you're in the `twixel` directory. All other commands you run from here on out will be in that directory.

ðŸ’¿ Ora puoi aprire il progetto in **Visual Studio Code**, questo Ã¨ il comando per farlo da terminale

```sh
code .
```
