## Resource Routes

Sometimes we want our routes to render something other than an HTML document. For example, maybe you have an endpoint that generates your social image for a blog post, or the image for a product, or the CSV data for a report, or an RSS feed, or sitemap, or maybe you want to implement API routes for your mobile app, or anything else.

This is what [Resource Routes](../guides/resource-routes) are for. I think it'd be cool to have an RSS feed of all our jokes. I think it would make sense to be at the URL `/jokes.rss`. For that to work, you'll need to escape the `.` because that character has special meaning in Remix route filenames. Learn more about [escaping special characters here](../api/conventions#escaping-special-characters).

<docs-info>Believe it or not, you've actually already made one of these. Check out your logout route! No UI necessary because it's just there to handle mutations and redirect lost souls.</docs-info>

For this one, you'll probably want to at least peek at the example unless you want to go read up on the RSS spec ðŸ˜….

ðŸ’¿ Make a `/jokes.rss` route.

![XML document for RSS feed](/jokes-tutorial/img/jokes-rss-feed.png)

Wahoo! You can seriously do anything you can imagine with this API. You could even make a JSON API for a native version of your app if you wanted to. Lots of power here.

ðŸ’¿ Feel free to throw a link to that RSS feed on `app/routes/index.tsx` and `app/routes/jokes.tsx` pages. Note that if you use `<Link />` you'll want to use the `reloadDocument` prop because you can't do a client-side transition to a URL that's not technically part of the React app.
