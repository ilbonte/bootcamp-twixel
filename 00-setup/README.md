## Setup

## Prerequisites

You can follow along with this tutorial on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.com/) (a fantastic in-browser editor) or locally on your own computer. If you use the CodeSandbox approach then all you need is a good internet connection and a modern browser. If you run things locally then you're going to need some things installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 14 or greater
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) 7 or greater
- A code editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a nice one)

We'll also be executing commands in your system command line/terminal interface. So you'll want to be familiar with that.

Some experience with React and TypeScript/JavaScript is assumed. If you'd like to review your knowledge, check out these resources:

- [JavaScript to know for React](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/javascript-to-know-for-react)
- [The Beginner's Guide to React](https://kcd.im/beginner-react)

And having a good understanding of [the HTTP API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP) is also helpful, but not totally required.

With that, I think we're ready to get started!
